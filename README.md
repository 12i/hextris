# About
Hextris was created by a couple high school friends (who are now in college!) who unfortunately don't have as much time to update the game. If you'd like to support the open-source development of Hextris, please consider donating at:

## Coinhive Disclosure

Hextris is also passively monetized with [Coinhive](https://coinhive.com/). We do this so that there are no ads to interupt gameplay, and so we can cover the yearly cost of the domain name.
